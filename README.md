# Programming-Tutorial-1
## Abstract
Programming is about solving problems.  This tutorial is meant to introduce the concepts a little differently than normal.  The plan is to provide a base problem and then work out a way to resolve the issue.  The initial language will be **JavaScript** but that is irrelavent to the purpose and goal of this tutorial.
